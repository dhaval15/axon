** Motivation
I have  been using org roam  for writing my notes  and much more
stuff. Orgmode  is great  on emacs but  outside emacs,  there is
limited  support (I  know there  is html  export and  publishing
utility) But this tool is not meant for publishing.

** Features
- [ ] OrgRoam Network (simmilar to org-roam-ui)
- [ ] Review system using org foot notes
- [ ] Dashboard and Saved queries
